OUT:
- still enemy that shoots in a pattern???
- moving enemy with a shiled that can damage the player ???


TODO:

- figure out how should the level "flow"!!!!
  - enemy spawn freqency
  - difficulty as game progresses
  - turret aiming???
  - chain activator movement control.
  
- enemy that moves and shoots bullets in N-directions
  - maybe make this enemy have bullets that infect the chain circles making them
    deadly for the player to be in them or touch them.

- sound:
  - player shoot, player hit, explosion, chain effects
  
- polish:
 - make the player a butterfly
